This repository demonstrates a tricky bug in Haskell related to overlapping instances. The `bug.hs` file contains code that exhibits unexpected behavior due to overlapping instances in the type class `C`.  The `bugSolution.hs` offers a corrected version with explanations and improvements. The core problem is ambiguity arising from the multiple instances attempting to handle lists of booleans. The solution addresses this by clarifying the type class hierarchy and instance definitions to avoid ambiguity and unexpected type inference.  The code includes simple examples to illustrate the problematic and corrected behavior of the `f` function.
